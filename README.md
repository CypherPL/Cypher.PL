# Cypher.PL


Cypher.PL is an executable specification of openCypher query language which 
Cypher.PL is written in SWI-Prolog which is a free implementation of the programming language Prolog.  
Cypher.PL is suppose to be as close to the  Cypher's semantics as possible and as far from the implementation issues as possible. 
Cypher.PL is conceived as a tool for collective designing, verification, validation of openCypher query language.


# Why Prolog?
Prolog has a lot enticements to be used as language for executable specifiaction of a declarative query language.
First of all it is declarative langauge itself with (term) unification as basic mechanism of calculation.
Term unification is a mechanism that is more general than pattern matching which is basic mechanism of openCypher.
This makes possible possible and easy to express openCypher's pattern matching as Prolog's unification.
